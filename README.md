eclipse-setup
=============

bash script to quickly setup eclipse the way I like

    git clone git@github.com:scottTomaszewski/eclipse-setup.git
    cd eclipse-setup.git
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh
    cd ..
    rm -rf eclipse-setup

This assumes 
- your eclipse install is at /opt/eclipse/
- you are executing as the intended user (not root)
- your workspace is located at ~/workspace
